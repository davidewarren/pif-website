And most of us don’t really think about having our health information readily accessible until we really need it – like in the event of an emergency, or when switching doctors or traveling. Combing through stacks of paperwork and contacting providers is daunting for even the most organized among us. However, this familiar scenario is being reimagined.", url: "https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/27/empowerment-innovation-and-improved-health-outcomes-the-blue-button-initiative/" }

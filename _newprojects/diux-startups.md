description: "<h5>As an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) organization, DIUx solves critical DoD technical challenges by leveraging commercial technology and/or methodologies.  The focus is on working with non-traditional companies (i.e., start-ups) who traditionally do not work with the DoD and/or see them as a customer.  DIUx leverages a unique mixture of military and tech experts to solve DoD customer problems while utilizing rapid acquisition vehicles as a means to an end - solving the problems.  These cross-functional and collaborative teams are comprised of military and civilians and can work together in ambiguous, bureaucratic environments.  Customers range from Services to COCOMS to SEAL teams.</h5>
 
<h5>DIUx’s technical focus areas include: 1) Autonomy (drones, robotics, counter-drones--in the air and underwater); 2) Space (includes launch, analytics on satellite data, space situational awareness); 3) AI/ML (decision making, autonomy applications, automation of cyber); 4) Human Systems (wearables on soldiers that provide real-time biometrics, situational awareness in combat, etc.); and 5) IT (catch-all for cyber security, networking, agile software development, big data and analytics)</h5>
 
<h5>DIUx is looking for two Presidential Innovation Fellows to help bridge the gap between the DoD and the tech and innovation community. These individuals should have a understanding of technology within DIUx’s focus areas (AI/ML, autonomy, networking and security, etc.), experience running large programs in the commercial world, entrepreneurial backgrounds with success in founding and selling a tech start-up and/or tech policy experience.</h5>

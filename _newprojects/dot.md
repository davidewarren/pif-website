description: "<h5>The Department of Transportation is looking for Presidential Innovation Fellows to provide thought leadership on how to accelerate the rollout of autonomous vehicles by looking at voluntary data exchanges and partnerships with the private sector and local jurisdictions. </h5>

<h5>The Fellows will also be looking at how to ensure system-wide cybersecurity as the transportation system becomes more automated and connected and legacy technologies become integrated with newer technologies. Additionally, the Fellows will be working to better understand how the DOT can strategically accelerate the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve transportation problems beyond automated vehicles and aerial systems. The Fellows will work toward deploying high-quality, user-centric platforms and services to lead major initiatives, consult on systems and policy proposals, and provide technical, policy, and programmatic guidance to DOT and the government.</h5>

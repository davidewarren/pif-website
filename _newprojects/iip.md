description: "<h5>The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) at the Department of State (DOS) supports people-to-people conversations with foreign publics on U.S. policy priorities. To carry out this mission, IIP leverages digital communications technology to reach across platforms - from traditional forms of communications to new media channels. The bureau takes a strategic, data-driven approach to develop multimedia, digital communications products and to manage an overseas network of bricks-and-mortar American Spaces.</h5>
 
<h5>Within IIP, the Office of Analytics seeks to engage and inform foreign publics using world-class analytics. IIP Analytics applies research, establishes and disseminates evidence-based and data-informed best practices at scale drawing on tools and resources from the DOS, U.S. Government and the private sector to understand audiences, plan engagements and measure the results (outputs, outcomes, impact) of Public Diplomacy programs.</h5>

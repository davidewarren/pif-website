description: "<h5>The Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (DC I&L)  is responsible for formulating Marine Corps logistics plans, policies, and concepts, exercising staff supervision over joint and Marine Corps logistics matters, logistics manpower matters, logistics analysis, mobility, lift requirements, sustainability productivity, material readiness, logistics information systems, security assistance, fiscal matters for appropriate division sponsored programs, and coordinating the logistics aspects of prepositioning programs.</h5>                       	
" 

description_more: "<h5>The last ten years have seen an exponential increase and availability of tech enablers, specifically in the area of logistics planning and operations. Unfortunately, the traditional processes inherent in DoD have caused late adoption, inconsistent performance, and inefficient investments throughout Logistics Enterprise IT.  Because of this, I&L is pursuing modernization across all areas of logistics: people, process, and technology. However, I&L has struggled to date to create the proper conditions for the Logistics IT Portfolio to be rapidly modernized through adoption of industry-standard best practices and contemporary technologies.  Much of this failure is due to a lack of appropriate technical aptitude paired with the right senior leader oversight for rapid decision making.</h5>

<h5>In order to catalyze this effort, DC I&L intends to conduct a digital transformation aimed at leveraging contemporary technology and processes to improve USMC logistics.  The transformation will be measured by logistics and defense industry standards, including the ability to sustain innovation through agile IT acquisition practice, as well as emergent defense concepts and requirements.  DC I&L is looking bring in a Log Chief Digital Officer and Log Chief Data Officer through the Presidential Innovation Fellows program to advise the Marine Corps logistics senior leaders in the assessment, planning, and execution of this transformation. These individuals will have the scope and authority to investigate any and all barriers towards digital transformation. They will report to a three-star general and be responsible for reviewing, enhancing, and augmenting current capabilities; integrating emergent technologies; and adapting business practices to more effectively manage the entire logistics IT systems portfolio.</h5>
